# NAD Analysis tools

## Introduction

This repository contains several Python scripts designed to analyze and
compare the products generated by various models over the Northern Adriatic
Sea. The results of these scripts are easily accessible trought some Jupyter
Notebooks.

Currently, there are two main tools available:

1. `trends_visualization.ipynb`: This tool allows for the comparison
   of temporal trends over a specific basin. It reads the
   STAT_PROFILES files generated by the
   [bit.sea](https://github.com/inogs/bit.sea) `compact_profile.py` 
   script and generates a selection of plots to provide insights into
   the content of the models.

2. `map_visualization.ipynb`: This tool allows to visualize 2d maps of
   different regions of the models. It also offers the possibility of
   show isolines of different indicatorss.


## Requirements

Beside some common scientific Python libraries (`NumPy`, `XArray`,
`Matplotlib`), the script of this repository use extensively
[bit.sea](https://github.com/inogs/bit.sea), a Python library
developed at [OGS](https://www.ogs.it) to manipulate data generated by
the models.



## Installation

These tools do not require any installation. It is enough to clone the git repository
and to run a jupyter notebook from the main directory of the repository.
