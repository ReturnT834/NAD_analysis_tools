# NAD Analysis tools

## Introduction

This repository contains several Python scripts designed to analyze and
compare the products generated by various models over the [Northern Adriatic
Sea](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gV_88HaR2j550k1CvT4DUNpKIml5bSXo/view). 
The results of these scripts are easily accessible trought the Jupyter
Notebooks listed below.

1. `trends_visualization.ipynb`: This tool allows for the comparison
   of temporal trends over a specific basin. It reads the
   STAT_PROFILES files generated by the
   [bit.sea](https://github.com/inogs/bit.sea) `compact_profile.py` 
   script and generates a selection of plots to provide insights into
   the content of the models.

2. `map_visualization.ipynb`: This tool allows to visualize 2d maps of
   different regions of the models. It also offers the possibility of
   show isolines of different indicators.


## Requirements

Beside some common scientific Python libraries (`NumPy`, `XArray`,
`Matplotlib`), the script of this repository use extensively
[bit.sea](https://github.com/inogs/bit.sea), an open source Python library
developed at [OGS](https://www.ogs.it) to manipulate data generated by
the models.



## Installation

These tools do not require any installation. It is enough to clone the git repository
and to run a jupyter notebook from the main directory of the repository.
